# üé® DreamLayer AI - A Modern Stable Diffusion Interface

## What It Is
DreamLayer AI is a **clean, modern web interface for AI image generation** that runs locally on your computer. Think of it as a user-friendly wrapper around ComfyUI (a powerful but complex AI image generation tool).

## Main Purpose
It allows users to generate AI images through an intuitive interface without dealing with complex node graphs or technical setups. It's designed for:
- **AI Artists** creating portfolio-ready artwork
- **Researchers** testing models and techniques  
- **Developers** building AI-powered applications
- **Prompt Engineers** experimenting with text-to-image generation

## üîß Core Features & How It Works

### 1. Text-to-Image Generation (Txt2Img Tab)
**What it does:** Creates images from text descriptions
```
User Input: "A majestic dragon flying over a medieval castle at sunset"
Output: AI-generated image matching the description
```

**Key Controls:**
- **Prompt boxes** for positive/negative descriptions
- **Sampling settings** (quality, steps, randomness)
- **Image dimensions** (width/height)
- **Batch generation** (create multiple variations)
- **Seed control** (reproducible results)

### 2. Image-to-Image Generation (Img2Img Tab)
**What it does:** Transforms existing images based on text prompts
```
User Input: Upload a photo + "Turn this into a Van Gogh painting"
Output: AI-modified image in Van Gogh style
```

**Key Features:**
- **Image upload** functionality
- **Denoising strength** (how much to change the original)
- **Same prompt controls** as txt2img
- **Style transfer** capabilities

### 3. Image Enhancement (Extras Tab)
**What it does:** Upscales and improves existing images
```
User Input: Low-res image (512x512)
Output: High-res enhanced image (2048x2048)
```

**Enhancement Options:**
- **Upscaling** (make images larger with AI)
- **Face restoration** (fix blurry or distorted faces)
- **Batch processing** (enhance multiple images)
- **Multiple AI models** for different enhancement types

### 4. Model Management (Configurations Tab)
**What it does:** Manages AI models and application settings
- **Model directories** configuration
- **Path management** for different model types
- **Server settings** and restart options

## üéõÔ∏è Advanced Features

### ControlNet Integration
**Purpose:** Precise control over image generation using reference images
**Example:** Upload a pose reference ‚Üí AI generates new image with same pose

### LoRA Support
**Purpose:** Fine-tuned model variations for specific styles
**Example:** Load a "Studio Ghibli" LoRA ‚Üí All images get anime-style treatment

### Multiple AI Models
**Local Models:** 
- Stable Diffusion checkpoints (.safetensors files)
- Custom trained models
- Community models from Civitai/HuggingFace

**Cloud APIs:**
- OpenAI DALL-E 2/3
- FLUX Pro/Dev
- Ideogram V3
- Runway Gen-4

## üîÑ How It All Works Together

```
User Interface (React) 
    ‚Üì
Flask API Servers
    ‚Üì
ComfyUI Backend
    ‚Üì
AI Models (Local/Cloud)
    ‚Üì
Generated Images
```

### The Process:
1. **User interaction** in the web interface (localhost:5173)
2. **API calls** to Flask servers (ports 5001-5004)
3. **Workflow execution** in ComfyUI (port 8188)
4. **AI processing** using local GPU or cloud APIs
5. **Results** displayed in the web interface

## üéØ What Makes It Special

### User Experience
- **Familiar layout** similar to Automatic1111 (popular AI image tool)
- **Clean, modern design** with dark/light themes
- **No complex node graphs** - just simple controls
- **Real-time previews** and progress tracking

### Technical Advantages
- **Local processing** - complete privacy, no data uploaded
- **ComfyUI backend** - leverages proven, stable technology
- **Modular architecture** - separate services for different functions
- **Cross-platform** - works on Windows, macOS, Linux

### Flexibility
- **Both local and cloud** AI models
- **Custom workflows** for advanced users
- **API integrations** for external services
- **Extensible** with custom nodes and models
